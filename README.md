# Weather-App-Project
This project fetches information from the Openweather database: https://openweathermap.org/. It's primary purpose is to showcase the temperature 
in Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit units. 
I created buttons that would allow the user to choose whether you would like to see their temperature in Kelvin, Celsius, or Fahrenheit. 
This project serves to further enhance my understanding of how fetching api from databases work, programming in javascript, 
and ultimately, how to debug code and write code that focuses on being user friendly.
